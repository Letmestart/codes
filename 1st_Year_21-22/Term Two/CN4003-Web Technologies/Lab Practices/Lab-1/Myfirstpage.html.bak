                <p>Coxes Bazar in Bangladesh:</STRONG></p>
                Cox’s Bazar Beach is the world’s longest unbroken sandy beach which is situated in Bangladesh. 
                The beach is 120 km long and it slopes gently down to the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal next 
                to the scenic backdrop of a sequence of hills covered with deep green forests. This kind of straight
                and smooth beach is scarcely seen in any place on the globe. The specialty of Cox’s Bazar beach includes 
                miles of golden sands, soaring cliffs, surfing waves, unusual conch shells, and enjoy seafood.
